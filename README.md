This Streamlit app is designed for limited partners (LPs) who invest in venture capital (VC) funds. This app can be used to test VC model assumptions (number of investments, investment size, etc.). The app has two simulation methods, discrete and power-law. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. Please refer to the app for further details.
